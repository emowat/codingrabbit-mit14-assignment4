# Assignment 4: Effective Programming in C and C++

Welcome to Assignment 4 - the final project!

This repository is fully configured with a GitHub Codespace environment. You do not need to install anything on your computer to complete this assignment—all coding, compiling, and testing can be done directly in your web browser.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (if not already done)
To use GitHub Codespaces, you must have a GitHub account. If you do not have one:
1. Go to [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) and create a free account.
2. Make sure you are logged in before proceeding to the next step.

## Step 1: Launch Your Environment
1. Go to [www.codingrabbit.dev](https://www.codingrabbit.dev) and sign in with the email address and password assigned to you.
2. On the left tab, click **Codespace Launch**.
3. Find your section and click **Launch Codespace**.
4. At that point, you will be asked to sign into GitHub.
5. A new browser tab will open with a web-based version of VS Code. Please wait a minute or two for the environment to build.

## Step 2: Sign into Coding Rabbit
Our custom AI Teaching Assistant, **CodingRabbit**, is pre-installed in your environment to help you learn! 
1. Click **Sign In**. This will securely open a *new browser tab* and ask you to log into the course platform.
2. After logging in successfully, the page will display your temporary authorization code. Click the **Copy** button on the screen.
3. Switch back to your original **VS Code browser tab** and **Paste** the code into the prompt window at the top center of the screen to finish signing in.
4. You can now use CodingRabbit for **Homework Assist** (to debug your current code) or **Study Assist** (to explain complex concepts)!

## Step 3: Start working on your final project
This may be done singly or in a group.  See `Instructions.pdf` for additional
guidelines.  Please provide the following in a markdown file - `Project.md`
* Overview of the project: What are the important features you've created? What was challenging, and what have you achieved?
* A short write-up describing the division of work. For example, "We decided to have person X and Y work primarily on the physics engine while Z developed the visualization components…"
* A short description of the project's structure, including descriptions of important classes and their interactions. If you can make a readable diagram of the interactions, you can submit that rather than a text description.
* Screenshots of the results and description of how to operate your project. Examples include images of the visualization in operation, what happens when you run certain n-body systems, etc.

Click on the **Coding Rabbit** icon on the left of the screen anytime you need help.

## Step 4: Shutting Down (Important!)
GitHub gives you a limited number of free compute hours per month for Codespaces. If you simply close your browser tab, the Codespace stays running in the background for 30 minutes before timing out, draining your free hours!

When you are done working for the day, **always stop your Codespace**:
1. Open the VS Code Command Palette by pressing **`F1`** (or click the gear icon in the bottom left -> Command Palette).
2. Type **`Codespaces: Stop Current Codespace`** and hit Enter.
3. You can safely close the tab once the session ends.

*(Alternatively, you can manage and stop your active environments at [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces))*

## Step 5: Saving & Submitting Your Work
Because you launched your Codespace from a template directly, your work is currently saved in an isolated, unpublished local repository inside the Codespace container. 

### How to Save Files
By default, VS Code will often auto-save your files. However, you can manually save any file by pressing **`Ctrl + S`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd + S`** (Mac) on your keyboard, or by clicking **File > Save** in the top menu bar.

### How to Submit (VS Code Method)
To safely back up your code to a private repository on your GitHub account and submit your assignment:
1. Open the **Source Control** panel (the Git icon on the left sidebar in VS Code).
2. Hover over the word **Changes** and click the **`+`** icon to stage all your changed files.
3. Type a message in the text box (like "Finished assignment") and click the **Commit** button.
4. Finally, click the large blue **Publish Branch** button.
5. VS Code will prompt you to publish to a private repository on your GitHub account. Follow the prompts to confirm.

### How to Submit (Terminal Method - Optional)
If you prefer using the command line, you can achieve the exact same result by running these commands in the terminal at the bottom of the screen:
1. `git add .` *(stages all your changed files)*
2. `git commit -m "Finished assignment"` *(saves the changes to history)*
3. `git push` *(VS Code will intercept this and ask if you want to publish the branch to a private repo)*

Your code is now safely backed up and visible in your new private GitHub repository!

## Step 6 (Optional, Advanced): Update Your Environment
This repository's `.devcontainer` setup (the tools and CodingRabbit extension pre-installed in your Codespace) is occasionally updated after courses have already started. If you're comfortable with git and want to pull in the latest version without disturbing your own work, run these commands in the terminal:

1. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/emowat/codingrabbit-mit14-assignment4.git` *(one-time setup — links you to the original course repository; skip this if you've already done it once)*
2. `git fetch upstream`
3. `git checkout upstream/main -- .devcontainer` *(pulls in only the environment configuration — your own code is untouched)*

VS Code will detect that the environment configuration changed and prompt you to rebuild your container — click **Rebuild** when asked, and your environment will update in place. This shows up as a normal file change afterward, so it'll be included automatically the next time you save/submit your work (Step 5 above).
